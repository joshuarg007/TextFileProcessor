# TextFileProcessor
 FileManipulator is a C++ program that allows users to append their input to an existing text file named CSC450_CT5_mod5.txt without deleting its contents. Additionally, it provides functionality to reverse the characters of the file's content and save the reversed text to CSC450-mod5-reverse.txt.
